Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. In this project, I examined past Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help contestant win.

My analysis shows that:
- The answer for 6.3% of past questions can be derived from the question itself.
- On average, 52.5% of terms used in new questions was recycled from old questions.
